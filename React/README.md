# React Notesüìù

## **Composition**

### What is composition and why is it a key concept in your React apps

> In programming, composition allows you to build more complex functionality by combining small and focused functions.

In the same way we compose various small Components to build a complex one. This help us to re-use Components.

---

## Immutability

React elements are immutable. Once you create an element, you can‚Äôt change its children or attributes. An element is like a single frame in a movie: it represents the UI at a certain point in time.
`React Only Updates What‚Äôs Necessary. To update its value, you create a new variable.`
For example, you should never mutate the state property of a component directly, but onlythrough the _setState()_ method. In Redux, you never mutate the state directly, but only through reducers, which are functions.

## **Virtual DOM v/s DOM**

- Every time the DOM changes, the browser has to do two intensive operations: repaint & reflow.
- _Virtual DOM helpful: batching_, React batches much of the changes and performs a unique update to the real DOM, by changing all the elements that need to be changed at the same time, so browser must perform just once

## Components

> Components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation.

### Function(_Stateless_) and Class(_Stateful_) Components

_Stateless/Presentational/Dumb component_:

```jsx
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}
```

_Stateful/Container/Smart component_:

```jsx
class Welcome extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;
  }
}
```

> | **Stateless component**     | **Stateful component**           |
> | --------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
> | When we only need props     | Dependent on state for rendering |
> | Moreover a static component | Interactive on page              |
> | Light weight component      | Heavy component                  |
> |                             |                                  |

## **State & Lifecycle**

```jsx
class example extends Component{
    constructor(props){
        super(props);
        this.state = {
            s1 : "xyz",
            s2 : "abc",
            .
        };
    }
```

**OR**

```jsx
class example extends Component{
    state = {
        s1 : "xyz",
        s2 : "abc",
        .
    }
```

> Whenever _setState()_ is called, React knows the state has changed, and calls the _render()_ method again to learn what should be on the screen. So, the new _this.state_ object is passed to _render()_ method will be different and React updates the DOM accordingly.

`React may batch multiple setState() calls into a single update for performance. Because this.props and this.state may be updated asynchronously, you should not rely on their values for calculating the next state.`

```jsx
// Wrong
this.setState({
  STATE_1: this.state.xyz + this.props.abc,
});
```

```jsx
// Correct
this.setState((state, props) => ({
  STATE_1: state.xyz + props.abc,
}));
```

### **this.setState(_function_) v/s this.setState(_object_)**

- JavaScript is faster when swapping an old object reference for an entirely new object, rather than mutating anexisting object. This gives you **performance**.
- In _functional way_ the merging is shallow, so this.setState({**STATE_1**}) leaves this.state.**OTHER** intact, but completely replaces this.state.**STATE_1**

### **Unidirectional Data Flow üåä**

> This is commonly called a ‚Äú_top-down_‚Äù or ‚Äú_unidirectional_‚Äù data flow. Any state is always owned by some specific component, and any data or UI derived from that state can only affect components ‚Äú_below_‚Äù them in the tree.

## Type checking & Default value for _props_

```npm
npm install --save prop-types
```

PropTypes is a great way to validate intended data types in our React app. Type checking our data with PropTypes helps us identify these bugs during development to ensure a smooth experience for our app's users.

By defaultProps, If any value is not required we need to specify a default value for it if it's missing when theComponent is initialized

### For Example:

```jsx
BlogPostExcerpt.propTypes = {
  title: PropTypes.string,
  description: PropTypes.string,
};
BlogPostExcerpt.defaultProps = {
  title: "",
  description: "",
};
```

## Presentational vs Container components

| Presentational components | Container components            |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Generating some markup    | Backend operations              |
| Stateless                 | Stateful                        |
| Work as leaf component    | Might handle various components |
